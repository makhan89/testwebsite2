<body> <!-- style="bacgroun-color: red;"  this within body is the way to change
                                            the background color or you can place a hex value instead of
                                            color name.
                                            <body style="background-color: #c8c6a7;">
                                             To use hex value we need a hashtage.
                                            #c8c6a7. This changes the website bacground color.
                                            This is one way to change the bacground color-->
